### A little about myself:
##### In the past, I created a project on Qurre. Many people say that this is a copy of Exiled and like to troll, but somehow my project was able to become big thanks to it. I am from Russia and in 2022 you yourself know what happened, but I made it my duty to settle the conflict between Qurre and Exiled, which I did. In 2023, I decided to port my old plugin from Qurre to Exiled, but I had to abandon many old and new ideas, as the NW developers added a stupid fog. It really interferes with making large maps. I had to concentrate on the quality of the code and the quality of the mini-games themselves. I have gone through a long path of suffering and torment, not only mental, but also physical. And finally the release. I hope we make this stupid game a good gmod (even if NW didn't like it lmao)
