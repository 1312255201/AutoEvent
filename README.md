## I will introduce you to the Mini-Games:
### Zombie Infection [zombie]
##### Zombie mode, the purpose of which is to infect all players. 
##### It's a pretty nice map, where it's nice to run away from zombies, but it's easy to get infected if you're careless.

### Atomic Escape [escape]
##### Escape from the facility behind SCP-173 at supersonic speed!
##### We need to escape from the complex behind SCP-173 before it explodes. There is music in the background that adds to the anxiety.

### Simon's Prison [jail]
##### You play as a Jailer and have to conduct games for Prisoners, for example, get into parkour or Simon says.
##### This mini-game requires an understanding of how to conduct the Jail mode, which is why I find it difficult.

### Cock Fights [versus]
##### The players are divided into teams. There is a box on the map in which members of different teams duel.
##### To participate, you need to go through the door.

### Knives of Death [knife]
##### The battle of the teams on knives.
##### It's very simple! The team that remains last survives.

### Territory of Death or Deathmatch [deathmatch]
##### Players are divided into teams and they need to kill players to become a winner.
##### A small closed map with a lot of spawns on it, so the gameplay is cheerful.

### Quick Hands or GunGame [gungame]
##### Every man for himself. Each player starts with a pistol and gradually finishes with big guns. In the end, you have to kill the players with a bat.
##### A small closed map with a lot of spawns on it, so the gameplay is cheerful.

### All those who helped.
##### Thanks to ART0022VI for a little help in fixing plugins.
##### Thanks to Alexander666 for the help at the initial stage of creating the plugin.
##### Thanks to art15 for writing the command code to run the mini-game.

### Code from other developers.
##### Thanks for the MapEditorReborn plugin to the developer Michal78900#8196.
##### Thanks for the code for the music to work to the developer ced777ric#8321.

#### A little about myself:
###### In the past, I created a project on Qurre. Many people say that this is a copy of Exiled and like to troll, but somehow my project was able to become big thanks to it. I am from Russia and in 2022 you yourself know what happened, but I made it my duty to settle the conflict between Qurre and Exiled, which I did. In 2023, I decided to port my old plugin from Qurre to Exiled, but I had to abandon many old and new ideas, as the NW developers added a stupid fog. It really interferes with making large maps. I had to concentrate on the quality of the code and the quality of the mini-games themselves. I have gone through a long path of suffering and torment, not only mental, but also physical. And finally the release. I hope we make this stupid game a good gmod (even if NW didn't like it lmao).
