## I'll introduce you to 20 mini-games I've made:

### Atomic Escape [escape]
##### Escape from the facility behind SCP-173 at supersonic speed!
##### We need to escape from the complex behind SCP-173 before it explodes. There is music in the background that adds to the anxiety.

### Cock Fights [versus]
##### The players are divided into teams. There is a box on the map in which members of different teams duel.
##### To participate, you need to go through the door.

### Knives of Death [knife]
##### The battle of the teams on knives.
##### It's very simple! The team that remains last survives.

### Simon's Prison [jail]
##### You play as a Jailer and have to conduct games for Prisoners, for example, get into parkour or Simon says.
##### This mini-game requires an understanding of how to conduct the Jail mode, which is why I find it difficult.

### Territory of Death or Deathmatch [deathmatch]
##### Players are divided into teams and they need to kill players to become a winner.
##### A small closed map with a lot of spawns on it, so the gameplay is cheerful.

### Quick Hands or GunGame [gungame]
##### Every man for himself. Each player starts with a pistol and gradually finishes with big guns. In the end, you have to kill the players with a bat.
##### A small closed map with a lot of spawns on it, so the gameplay is cheerful.
